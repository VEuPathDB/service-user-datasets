[NOTE]
This repository is a thin demonstrative wrapper around the
https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-jaxrs-container-core[Core container library],
for more in depth documentation of available features and config options see
the core library's readme.

== Running the Example

=== Locally

==== Prerequisites

* Maven
* NodeJS/NPM
* Github credentials providing access to https://github.com/VEuPathDB/maven-packages[VEuPathDB packages]

==== Setup & Run

Environment/dependency setup for local development can be done via the command
`make install-dev-env`.  This will install the dependencies required to build the
project.

After the environment has been set up, the project can be built, tested, and
packaged using `make jar`.

Starting the server can be done by running `java -jar build/libs/service.jar`.

[WARNING]
--
Most projects will require some CLI or environment arguments to run.  For a full
listing of available options see the
https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-jaxrs-container-core[core container library]
documentation.
--

[NOTE]
--
All project specific system level dependencies must be installed locally for
this to work.
--

=== In Docker

==== Prerequisites

* Docker
* Docker Compose

==== Setup & Run

The project container can be built using `make docker`.  The first build
of the container will take several minutes.

Running the built container can be done with:
----
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
----

[WARNING]
--
Most projects will require some CLI or environment arguments to run.  For a full
listing of available options see the
https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-jaxrs-container-core[core container library]
documentation.  When using docker-compose these options can be
https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/[set automatically]
through the use of a `.env` file.

== Development

=== Quick Start for New Projects

. Create a new project from this template by clicking the "*Use this template*"
button above.
. Clone your new project and cd into the clone directory
. Run `make new-project-initialization` +
  This will:
  .. Link your new project's git history with the git history of this template
     repo which will enable the ability to pull fixes and updates from this
     template into your new project.
  .. Install the dev tools needed to build and test your project.
. Edit `build.gradle.kts` with your service's details
. Edit `api.raml` with your API design
. Create any necessary types in `docs/schema`
. Run `make gen-jaxrs` to generate skeleton code
. Further rename and edit the Java packages and source code under `src/` as desired
. Implement the generated service interfaces
. Register your services in the `Resources` class
. Run `make test` to run any unit tests and verify that things compile

=== Quick Start for Contributing

. Clone this project and cd into the clone directory
. Run `make link-template-repo` +
  This will link your currently checked out project back up to the template repo
  which will enable the ability to pull in fixes and updates published to that
  template.
. Run `make install-dev-env` +
This will install the dev tools needed to build and test the project.
. Edit `build.gradle.kts` with your service's details

=== Detailed Overview

==== Environment Prerequisites

NPM:: Required to run https://github.com/raml2html/raml2html[raml2html]
Maven:: Required to build
https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-for-jax-rs[raml-to-jaxrs]

==== Configuration

Configuration for the build is primarily done through the `build.gradle.kts`
file.  Here you can configure the project's name, version, container name,
Java package structure, etc. as well as define your project's dependencies.

For information about adding gradle dependency declarations see the
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html[Gradle docs].

==== API definition

The service api is defined in 2 places initially:

. The `api.raml` file which contains the server endpoints.
. The `schema/url` folder which contains type schema definitions. +
  These files must be valid Raml 1.0 Libraries.footnote:[https://medium.com/raml-api/raml-101-libraries-and-datatypes-fragments-1889b2e82c27[Modular Raml Guide 1]]footnote:[https://www.baeldung.com/modular-raml-includes-overlays-libraries-extensions[Modular Raml Guide 2]]

===== `api.raml`

====== Including Type Definitions

In the `api.raml` file, there is a statement near the top of the file that
declares the Raml file "uses" `schema/library.raml`.  This is a generated
file based on the contents of the schema library under `schema`.  The
`library.raml` file should not be edited directly.

.`api.raml`: `uses` declaration
[source, yaml, linenums, start=5]
----
uses:
  err: .tools/raml/errors.raml
  lib: schema/library.raml
----

The `uses` keyword maps an import alias to the imported library.  This import
alias is used to access the types defined in that library.  In the case of the
above example, library types would be available using `lib.\{MyTypeName}`

.`api.raml`: Library type usage.
[source, yaml, linenums, start=36]
----
        body:
          application/json:
            type: lib.HelloResponse
----

===== Type Schema

Each raml library file under `schema` should define a root `types` object
defining the types used by the API.  The name of the types defined under the
`types` object will be the name of the generated Java classes based on those
types.

  @JsonProperty("foo")
  public String getFoo() {
    return this.foo;
  }

  @JsonProperty("foo")
  public void setFoo(String foo) {
    this.foo = foo;
  }
}

==== Generating a Service

Once your API spec is complete, you can begin development of Java code by
running `make gen-jaxrs`.  This will create a skeleton of the API in the
`generated` source package located under the root package defined using the
`projectPackage` value in `build.gradle.kts`.

The generated interfaces and types have the basic necessary annotations for use
by both Jackson and Jersey.

Once you have implemented the interfaces defined under
`\{source-package}.generated.resources` they must be registered in the
`\{source-package}.Resources` class.

==== Run Your Service

Running your service locally can be done by following the same steps as defined
above in the <<Running the Example>> section:

. Run `make jar`
. Run `java -jar build/libs/service.jar`

Running in Docker can be done by:

. Run `make build-docker`
. Run `docker run <your-image-name>`

== Other Information

=== Authentication

The base service contains an authentication layer that will be enabled on any
service class or method annotated with `@Authenticated`.  This authentication
will validate a VEuPathDB user session against the configured account- (for
registered users) and user- (for guest users) databases and append user
profile information to the incoming request object.

=== Make Targets


==== Meta Targets

`help`::
. Lists the available make targets. +
This is the default target that will be executed if you just run `make`.


==== Project & Environment Setup Targets

`new-project-initialization`::
. Runs the make target `link-template-repo`
. Merges the git history of a new template-based project with the git history of
  template that the project was based on. +
. Runs the make target `install-dev-env`

`link-template-repo`::
. Links the currently cloned repository back up to the template repository from
  which the project was created. +
  This is done to allow pulling in fixes and updates from the template into the
  template based project.

`merge-template-repo`::
. Pulls in changes from the template repo from which this project was created.

`install-dev-env`::
. Checks for system prerequisites.
. Downloads and builds raml-to-jaxrs.
. Installs the Oracle JDBC components into the `vendor` directory.
. Downloads, builds, and installs the FgpUtil project into the `vendor`
directory.
. Installs the required NPM packages


==== Build & Test Targets

`compile`::
. Generates code & docs if the API def has changed.
. Compiles Java code if anything has changed.

`test`::
. Generates code & docs if the API def has changed.
. Compiles Java code if necessary.
. Runs unit tests.

`jar`::
. Generates code & docs if the API def has changed.
. Compiles Java code if necessary.
. Runs unit tests if necessary.
. Packages a self-contained runnable jar.

`docker`::
. Runs `docker build` for the project.


==== Code & Doc Generation

`raml-gen-code`::
. Generates JAX-RS Java code from the RAML spec.

`raml-gen-docs`::
. Generates API docs from the RAML spec.

=== Build Process

Presently the build process is operated through a makefile which calls and sets
up the necessary prerequisites.  This is a temporary solution to be used until
all the utilities in https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-jaxrs-container-build-utils[the build utils project]
are migrated to https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-gradle-container-utils[the gradle plugin project].

==== Generating Jax-RS Code

The `make gen-jaxrs` command is backed by the https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-for-jax-rs[Mulesoft Raml-for-JaxRs library].

===== Hiccups and limitations

The RAML to JaxRS conversion library has the following known issues that are
likely to impact use of the tool:

Enums::
+
--
* Enum generation creates types that do not allow access to the raw backing
  text, which may be desired when constructing complex responses.
* Enum generation may cause the generator to fail with cryptic errors involving
  bad imports for the Java builtin type `String`
--
+
One alternative/workaround for this is defining the enum type in Java and typing
the RAML as string with the possible values defined as examples.

Inheritance::

Extending types can work out for trees with at most 1 parent depth, however
going beyond that may cause things to generate in a way that has compile errors.

`additionalProperties` aka `//:`::

Using a catchall block for maps with anything other than a simple value type
will cause the java type to be `Map<String, Object>`.  Additionally even a
simple value type _may_ have this result.

=== Tunnels and Proxies

When developing or testing a service, you may need to provide that service
access to resources that cannot be reached without a tunnel or proxy.  This is
complicated by the fact that Docker containers, by default, will not see those
resources.

To allow Dockerized services access to these external resources, the running
container(s) must be given access to the host machine's network.  This can be
done via `docker run` using the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings[network mode "host"]
or via `docker-compose` by setting the
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#network_mode[`network_mode`]
config option to "host".

Binding the containers to your host machine's network will give the containers
access to your running tunnels/proxies, but will also mean binding all exposed
container ports to those ports on your host machine which may cause conflicts.

=== The project root

The root directory of this project contains multiple standard files used by
Gradle, Docker, Make, and GitHub, in addition to custom files created for
developer convenience.
